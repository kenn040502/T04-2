      <!-- Q1 -->
      <div class="panel">
        <h2>Q1. What TV screen technologies are available and which are most frequent?</h2>
        <img src="images/Q1.png" alt="Chart of TV screen technologies by frequency" loading="lazy" />
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Available technologies include LCD (LED), LCD, and OLED. The most frequent in the dataset is LCD (LED).</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Q2 -->
      <div class="panel">
        <h2>Q2. What screen sizes are available, and which are most frequent?</h2>
        <img src="images/Q2.png" alt="Chart of TV screen size buckets by frequency" loading="lazy" />
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Common buckets include 22–24, 32–33, 43–44, 55–56, 65–66, 75–76 inches, plus an “Other” bucket. The most frequent size is 55–56 inches. </p>

      <!-- Q4 -->
      <div class="panel">
        <h2>Q4. Which screen technology uses the least power?</h2>
        <img src="images/Q4.png" alt="Chart comparing average power by screen technology" loading="lazy" />
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> LCD shows the lowest average active power among the listed technologies.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Q5 -->
      <div class="panel">
        <h2>Q5. What is the relationship between screen size and power use?</h2>
        <img src="images/Q5.png" alt="Scatter showing screen size vs average power" loading="lazy" />
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> As screen size increases, average power usage generally increases. </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Q6 -->
      <div class="panel">
        <h2>Q6. What is the relationship between star rating and screen size?</h2>
        <img src="images/Q6.png" alt="Plot of star rating versus screen size" loading="lazy" />
        <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> Higher star ratings tend to be associated with larger average screen sizes in this dataset. </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Across the six questions, the dataset suggests a clear pattern: mainstream TVs are dominated by LED/LCD,
        mid-range sizes (around 55″) are most common, and average power use generally rises with screen size.
        Technology choice still matters—some panels tend to draw less power at comparable sizes—and energy star ratings
        help compare efficiency across models.
